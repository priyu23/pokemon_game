// for each battle, randomly pull 2 Pokemon out of the Pokeball
// let them each do their Attack
// Strongest Attack Wins!
// Output the contestants and the Winners!!!
// POKEMON: I CHOOSE YOU!

// Part Two: #todo: Give your Pokemon Names and Types: Create an array of Names
// use rand to select a Name for each Pokemon
// make sure to remove that name from the array so it is not issued Twice!!!  

// Part Three: #todo: Create a POKEDEX to store the results of BATTLES
